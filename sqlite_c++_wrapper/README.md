# SQLite C++ Wrapper
## Introduction to SQLite C++ Wrapper
Managing data efficiently is crucial for any software application, and SQLite is a popular choice for developers due to its lightweight and easy-to-use nature. However, working directly with SQLite's C API can be challenging, especially for C++ developers.

The SQLite C++ Wrapper is here to simplify that process. This library provides a straightforward and user-friendly interface for interacting with SQLite databases in C++. By wrapping the complexities of the SQLite API, it allows developers to focus on building their applications without getting lost in low-level details.

With features like automatic memory management and easy integration with C++ data types, the SQLite C++ Wrapper makes it easier than ever to work with databases. Whether you're creating a small project or a larger application, this wrapper will help you manage your data efficiently and effectively. Dive in and see how the SQLite C++ Wrapper can enhance your development experience!

## How to use SQLite C++ Wrapper
*For Windows Users (Setup)*
1. Open command prompt and go to the `src` folder.
2. Run `createLibrary.bat`. (If everything is fine, it will generate `sqliteWrapper.lib` file)

*For Linux Users (Setup)*
1. Open terminal and go to the `src` folder.
2. Run `chmod +x createLibrary.sh` and `dos2unix createLibrary.sh`.
